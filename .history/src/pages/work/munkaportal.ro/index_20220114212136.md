The munkaportal.ro was designed as a lightweight landing page for the jobp.eu portal. It's uses basic web technologies, html, css and the good old javascript.  

Even so quite a few features was built in, like the homemade (by us) translation plugin, which delivers the content on 4 languages, using a json database. Besides the responsive javascript slider,  the brightest feature is the job post form, which is not using any plugins or frameworks for form validation, but it doing it byself
