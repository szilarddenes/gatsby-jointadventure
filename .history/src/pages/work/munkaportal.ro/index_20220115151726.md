The munkaportal.ro was designed as a lightweight landing page for the jobp.eu portal. It is based on web technologies, like <c>html</c>, <c>css</c> and the good old <c>javascript</c>.  

Even so, quite a few features was built in, like the <c>in house translation plugin</c>, which delivers the content in 4 languages.  

 Next to this, and our <c>responsive slider</c>, the brightest feature of the site is the job posting <c>form</c>. No plugins or frameworks are used for form validation, but it handles with pure javascript. The form gets submitted to <c>google sheets</c>, which sends automatic notification to our admins.  

 All this done in pure <c>javascript</c>. Simply and fast.
