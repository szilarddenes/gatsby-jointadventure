The munkaportal.ro was designed as a lightweight landing page for the jobp.eu portal. Uses basic web technologies, like html, css and the good old javascript.  

Even so, quite a few features was built in, like the in house translation plugin, which delivers the content on 4 languages.  

 Besides the responsive slider,  the brightest feature is the job post form, which isn't using any plugins or frameworks for form validation, but it handles with pure javascript. The form gets submitted to a google sheet, which sends automatic notification to our admins.  

 All this done in pure javascript.
