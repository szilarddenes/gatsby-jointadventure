<center>Don't panic, we do like beerüçª as much as working.  </center>  


Reading the first 2 sentences, you might be wondering about the lack of enumerating our awards, qualifications and 10+ years experience in the web development industry, and you might be right. We don't have that.  
 
Our skill set is different: 

- as mentioned earlier, we're geoscientists and engineers who are trying to do more than to study the earth. We started to explore the clouds since more than 10 years and get involved in the web development. 
- this way we earned experience in creating webshops, marketing on instagram, facebook and google    
- we learnt how to create basic and complex websites, and find a solution for everything through this time    
- our highlighted skills could be sketched as: perfectionism and availability($), at least related to rest of web industry    
- one thing came into my mind: being partners since 10+ years makes our workflow smooth and easy
- and the most important: we know how to fail. we failed so much.  

Anyhow, if you need a website, and you respect the honest words, don't be afraid, contact us (we are human as you -- do the image is only for illustration purposes -- ), and we will get back to you in a few hours.
