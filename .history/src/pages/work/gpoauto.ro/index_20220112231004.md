A blazing fast one page website for the GPO auto driving school based in Odorheiu-Secuiesc (RO). 
The site was created to reflect the corporate's identity design, and to serve a platform where a future client can get basic information of the `#GPO sofőriskola` driving school's services. 

The main features asked by the client or recommended and implemented by us are the next:
 * responsive banner image
 * card with the sevice
 * about us section
 * slider with former students
 * contact us section
 * a contact form
 * interactive map with the companies location  

To achieve the requirements of our client, we've used and welded <highlight>together </highlight> several technologies. For the fronted stuff, we are using the blazing fast Gatsby static site generator, which is a React Js based framework. This static site, sits on a shared host, which is in a direct communication with the projects's github repository. The static site, obviously is is speed oriented, and it is using the latest available technologies to work around the good old performance issues, like code splitting, unused css, FOUC, and image compression.<br/>Thank you 💜GatsbyJs. <br/>
Besides these, an Nginx based AWS EC2 instance serves the backend for the NodeJs application, which operates the contact form submissions. For e-mail sending we use the NodeMailer as a mail provider.  
Besides these, several backend technologies were implemented, to make the API and Linux based server side secure and fluent.
