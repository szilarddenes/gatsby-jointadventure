The JobP.eu is a Wordpress based job portal, where a basic template was reworked and upgraded to satisfy our needs. The users, both, employees and employers can register on the site, and handle their job posts or applications. The non authenticated users can apply on jobs as well.   

Regarding the fronted features, the biggest improvement was implementing a leaflet map, which shows the job posts by location, and with a popup marker a job application is available also. Besides this, several search and filter options are available to browse the job posts.  

Each user id able to handle its job applications/resumes or job posts using the dashboard.
