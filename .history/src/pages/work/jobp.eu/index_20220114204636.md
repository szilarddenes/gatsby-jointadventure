The JobP.eu is a <c>Wordpress</c> based job portal, where a basic template was reworked and upgraded to satisfy our needs. <c>The UI Design</c> and implementation in code was totally made by JointAdVenture.

The portal is <c>user oriented</c>. Both, the applicants and employers can register, and handle their subscription, job posts or job applications using the dashboard. In case of a job application the applicant can attach his resume which gets uploaded to the JobP <c>database</c> and emailed to the employer. The non authenticated users can apply on jobs as well via e-mail or <c>WhatsApp</c>.   

Regarding the fronted features, the biggest improvement was implementing a leaflet map, which shows the job posts by location, and with a popup marker the application on jobs is available also. Besides this, several search and filter options are available to browse the job posts.  

The site is available on English and Hungarian languages. We are offering Facebook, GoogleAds and Instagram marketing through the JobP portal to our clients, who wants to hire quickly. According to the requirements of a modern platform, the users can process their payments and subscriptions through secured SSL
