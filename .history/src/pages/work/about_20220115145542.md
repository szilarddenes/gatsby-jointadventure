We are a creative web agency who <c>builds websites</c> and <c>broadcasts your brand</c>. The staff behind the company could be characterized like engineers, dreamers, scientists, geologists, realists, tech geeks, and high performing problem solvers who likes to create.  
</br>
<center>Don't panic, we do like beer🍻 as much as working. Reversing the logic, that means, we like working as much as beer. 🍺👨‍💻  </center>

Reading the first 2 sentences, you might be wondering about the lack of enumerating our awards, qualifications and 10+ years professional experience in the web development industry, and you might be right. We don't have that.

Our skill set is different:

- as mentioned earlier, we're <c>geoscientists</c> and <c>engineers</c> who are trying to do more than study the earth. We started to explore the <c>cloud</c> since more than 10 years and got involved in the web development.
- this way we earned experience in creating <c>webshops</c>, <c>websites</c>, <c>portals</c>, <c>marketing campaigns</c> on instagram, facebook and google
- we learnt how to create basic and complex <c>websites</c>, and find <c>solutions</c> for everything through this time
- our highlighted skills could be sketched as: <c>perfectionism</c> and availability(<c>$</c>), at least, compared to bulk majority of web industry
- one thing came into my mind: being partners since <c>10+</c> years makes our workflow smooth and easy
- and the most important: we know how to fail. we <c>failed</c> so much...and <c>learnt</c> so much..

Anyhow, if you need a website, and you respect the honest words, don't be afraid, contact us (we are human as you -- do the image is only for illustration purposes -- ), and we will get back to you in a few hours.
